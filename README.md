🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) - Practical Implementations
Welcome to my DSA Repository, where I explore essential data structures and algorithms through practical code implementations. This collection serves as both a reference and a learning resource for fundamental DSA concepts.
This repository holds all the practicals that I've executed and performed as a part of SPPU AI&DS Sem-IV - DSAL course.



📌 Overview
This repository contains structured implementations of various data structures, along with concise explanations of their principles and applications. Whether you're revising concepts or looking for optimized solutions, this repo has something valuable for you.


📂 Contents:

🔍 Data Structures
🔹 Hash Table
A Hash Table stores key-value pairs using a hash function, allowing O(1) average-time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion. 📌 Key Applications: Symbol tables, caching mechanisms, indexing databases.

🔹 Tree
A Tree is a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes. Trees are useful for search operations and hierarchical data representation. 📌 Key Applications: XML parsing, filesystem hierarchy, AI decision trees.

🔹 Graph
A Graph consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are widely used in modeling networks, social connections, and pathfinding. 📌 Key Applications: GPS navigation, web crawling, recommendation systems.

🔹 Binary Search Tree (BST)
A BST is a tree structure where the left child has smaller values, and the right child has larger values, enabling efficient search operations. 📌 Key Applications: Database indexes, dynamic searching, memory allocation.

🔹 AVL Tree
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing BST where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most one. Balancing ensures optimal search performance. 📌 Key Applications: Memory management, priority queues, fast lookups.

🔹 Multiway Trees
A Multiway Tree extends traditional binary trees by allowing more than two child nodes per parent, making it highly effective for hierarchical data management. 📌 Key Applications: Database indexing (B-Trees & B+ Trees), file systems, decision trees in AI.

🔹 File Organisation
File Organisation refers to techniques for storing and retrieving files efficiently. Methods include Sequential, Direct, Indexed file structures. 📌 Key Applications: Database systems, file storage management.
